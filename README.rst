en-lanc
========
A language pair for Apertium.

Contains only the dictionaries and other files, so will need compiling. However, the pair comes with instructions to work from scratch, finally viewing in `apertium-tolk`.

At the time of writing the pair is not heavily developed. It consists of a maybe 250 word dictionary, auto-generated from templates. with a couple of helper transfer rules.

Lancashire langauge was recorded by many people by notation of spoken speech. So all notations are different. The current build has a special spelling system, not fully implemented, which ignores these notations for a common talk. The pair will be poor at traslating lanc-en, but perhaps instructive working en-lanc.

eng-eng_lanc
============
A language pair for Apertium.

Contains only the dictionaries and other data files, so will need compiling. Current versions are designed using the /trunk English monodix. The pair comes with instructions to work from scratch, finally viewing in `apertium-tolk`.

At the time of writing the pair is not heavily developed. It consists of a maybe 250 word dictionary, auto-generated from templates. with a couple of helper transfer rules.

Lancashire langauge was recorded by many people by notation of spoken speech. So all notations are different. The current build has a special spelling system, not fully implemented, which ignores these notations for common talk. The pair will be poor at translating eng_lanc-eng, but perhaps instructive working eng-eng_lanc.

Current version is a complete rewrite of the first commit, so now (not because it is mature) version 1.

= Apertium/tolk, new pairs

== Setup

=== Install needed build tools

autoconf
autogen

=== Install prerequisites
Get the more developed stuff than the packages,
http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Prerequisites_for_Debian

=== Setup a new set of languages
Make a folder, then use the Python appertium-init script,
http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Apertium_New_Language_Pair_HOWTO


=== Setup the build

cd apertium-fie
./autogen.sh
cd ..

cd apertium-bar
./autogen.sh
cd ..

cd apertium-fie-bar
./autogen.sh --with-lang1=../apertium-foo --with-lang2=../apertium-bar

=== Making the build
Open in the bilingual folder and this will compie everything (mono languages also),

make -j3 langs

(-j3: use three cores if possible)

== Testing and making

=== Single dictionaries
Any single dictonary can be compiled individually.

make


To test the dictonary,

echo "house" | lt-proc xxx.automorf.bin

In the translate to language directory, much the same,

echo "house" | lt-proc yyy.automorf.bin

to see what it generates (or if it will generate).

 
=== Overall
In the bilingual folder,

make -j3 langs

To test the dictionary, do as above on the jopint dictionary,

echo "house" | lt-proc xxx-yyy.automorf.bin

To test the translation,

echo "house" | apertium -d . xxx-yyy

to see what it sees. To try in reverse,

echo "house" | apertium -d . yyy-xxx


Hopelessly outdated compile instructions,

== Using tolk
Install tolk from Debian package. It has not changed much, and compile is unreliable,

apertium-tolk
(will also install apertium-dbus)

Now reposition the overall install (bilingual dictionary) into the main directories (I can not get it to work otherwise, at the moment, tolk just hunts it's local folders, so you would have to compile and install tolk to work from /usr/local/share)

Empty anything there,

make clean

Retarget (note the prefix),

./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --with-lang1=../apertium-fie --with-lang2=../apertium-bar

compile,

make

install,

sudo make install

Now run tolk

$ apertium-tolk

Language pair should be listed.
